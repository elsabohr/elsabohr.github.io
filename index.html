</header>

<h2>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</h2>
<p>
	<strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
	<li><em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
	<li><em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
	<li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
	<li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>
</ul>
<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
<p>
	You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.
</p>
<h2>Let it breathe</h2>
<p>
	Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum <code>line-height: 1.4</code> for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.
</p>
<p>
	If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.
</p>
<h2>A little less contrast</h2>
<p>
	Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.
</p>
<h2>Size Matters</h2>
<p>
	I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.
</p>
<h2>Line-width, motherfucker</h2>
<p>
	Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.
</p>
<h3>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</h3>
<p>
	I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's inspiration</a> did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.

<h2>Here's the basic algorithm for a minimum awesome landing page</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Do some very basic quick research and find out:
		<ul>
			<li>Who your potential customers are (profile) so that you can speak in their language</li>
			<li>What problems they have (pains) so that you can reassure them that you solve these</li>
			<li>What they want (dreams) so that you can promise it to them</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Make a promise with your headline to grab attention</li>
	<li>Use your subheadline to clarify the headline</li>
	<li>Use benefit-oriented call to action text to make people click</li>
	<li>State main benefits and how you plan to deliver them</li>
	<li>Explain benefits <em>and</em> features that provide them in-depth</li>
	<li>Finish with a second call to action</li>
</ol>
